# The Random Internet

This website takes you to some of the most interesting websites on the internet. You can use this website anytime you want to. The main purpose of The Random Internet is to utilize the time whenever you are using the internet (or, on a break from your work, or whatever ðŸ˜…) and don't know what to surf. The sites here are cool, interesting (AFAIK), and most importantly, impeccible usage of your time.

Don't believe me? You can look for yourself by click the big, "Discover" button. Or, if you want, you can have your money back (only, if you paid). Talking of money ðŸ¤‘, you can donate me (or, buy me a coffee, here [Donate page in progress] ðŸ˜…).

The idea of this website is inspired from The Useless Web. Gradients from uiGradients
